# Homebridge Mitsubishi Heat Pump

HomeKit control for Mitsubishi ductless heat pumps (MLZ / MSZ) through the Mitsubishi
Comfort v3 cloud API, with optional direct LAN control.

Each unit is a **HeaterCooler** with its fan on a linked Fan service: power, mode,
setpoints, fan speed and vane swing all on one tile.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Mitsubishi Electric. **Use at your
own risk** — this drives real heating and cooling equipment, and the author assumes no
liability for damage or loss arising from it.

## Features

- **One tile per unit.** On/off, Heat / Cool / Auto, and the setpoint for the active
  mode. Auto shows a two-handle band.
- **Fan speed on the tile** — five real speeds plus fan-auto, on a linked Fan service.
- **Vane control** — swing on the main tile, discrete tilt angles through an opt-in
  `Slats` service.
- **Fahrenheit-anchored setpoints.** Every setpoint is stored as the exact Celsius of a
  whole °F, so the Home app and the Comfort app show the same number.
- **Wireless sensor support.** Units with a paired sensor report its finer temperature
  and humidity, plus battery level with a low-battery warning.
- **Real-time streaming** over Socket.IO, with adaptive polling that starts only when
  streaming fails.
- **Device mirroring** (opt-in) — make one unit follow another.
- **Local LAN control** (opt-in) — currently blocked by a vendor change, see below.

## Installation

Requires **Node.js 20.19+, 22.12+, or 24+** (the HTTP client is ESM-only and `require()`
of it fails on older releases) and **Homebridge 1.6.0+, including 2.x**.

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-mitsubishi-heatpump
```

From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ukaratay/homebridge-mitsubishi-heatpump.git
cd homebridge-mitsubishi-heatpump
npm install && npm run build && npm link
```

Then add your credentials — see **[Configuration](docs/configuration.md)** for the
minimal config and every option.

## Migrating from homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort

This is a hard fork of
[homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort](https://github.com/burtherman/homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort)
at v1.8.2. It keeps the config `platform` key `KumoV3` and still derives accessory UUIDs
from the device serial, so **your existing `config.json` works unchanged and your
accessories keep their identity**.

| Thing | Survives? |
|---|---|
| `config.json` platform block | ✅ `platform` is still `KumoV3` |
| Child-bridge pairing | ✅ pairing lives at the bridge, `_bridge.username` untouched |
| Room assignment, names, Favorites | ✅ accessory UUID derives from `deviceSerial` |
| `mirror` config | ✅ keyed on device serial |
| **Automations, scenes, Shortcuts** | ❌ **these break** |

### What breaks

The primary service changed from `Thermostat` to `HeaterCooler`. HomeKit binds automations
to a *service and characteristic instance*, not to the accessory, so **every automation,
scene, trigger or Shortcut that referenced the old thermostat stops working and must be
rebuilt**. The accessory is still there under the same name in the same room; only the
controls beneath it are new. There is no way to migrate these automatically.

### Upgrade steps

1. **Stop Homebridge.** `sudo hb-service stop`
2. **Uninstall the old plugin from the command line**, not the Homebridge UI:
   ```bash
   sudo hb-service remove homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort
   ```
   > ⚠️ **Not via the Homebridge UI.** Its uninstall dialog defaults to "remove config",
   > which deletes the whole platform block *including* `_bridge.username`. Losing that
   > changes the child bridge's identity and forces you to re-pair every unit.
3. **Install this plugin.** `sudo hb-service add homebridge-mitsubishi-heatpump`
   > ⚠️ **Never have both installed at once.** Two plugins registering the `KumoV3`
   > platform makes Homebridge throw an ambiguous-platform error, which it swallows into a
   > misleading "Could not find the associated plugin" and drops your accessories.
4. **Start Homebridge.** `sudo hb-service start`
5. Rebuild your automations and scenes against the new tiles.

## Modes and switches

`HeaterCooler`'s target mode is only Heat / Cool / Auto — on/off is a separate `Active`
characteristic, and there is no state for dehumidify or fan-only. So:

- **On/off is independent of mode.** Turning a unit off does not change which mode it
  returns to.
- **Setpoints are the two thresholds.** The Home app shows the heating threshold in Heat,
  the cooling threshold in Cool, and both as a band in Auto. Modes the unit's profile says
  it cannot do are removed from the picker.
- **What the unit is doing is reported honestly:** heating, cooling, or **idle** when the
  compressor is in standby or the unit is in fan-only.
- **Fan speed and fan-auto** are on a linked Fan service — five speeds at 0 / 25 / 50 /
  75 / 100 on the slider, plus Auto on units whose profile has it.
- **Dry** and **Fan-only** are opt-in switches (`showDrySwitch`, `showFanOnlySwitch`),
  added only on units that support them, and mutually exclusive. Dry reports as Cool,
  where its setpoint genuinely lives. Changing fan speed while heating or cooling needs no
  switch.
- **Indoor humidity** is a HumiditySensor, on by default. Turn it off if the Home app's
  collapsed tile shows humidity where you wanted temperature.
- **Filter indicator** appears when the unit reports its filter needs cleaning.

> **Note:** HomeKit caches an accessory's services. If a newly-supported switch or the
> Auto range doesn't appear after an update, reboot your Home hub or iOS device.

### Vane and swing

Swing on/off lives on the main tile via `SwingMode`. Apple Home does not render an
Oscillate toggle for a collapsed accessory's fan service, which is why swing is on the
climate service and not the fan.

Discrete tilt angles need `exposeVaneSlat`, which is **off by default**. Apple Home
categorises a HAP `Slats` service as a **window covering**: turned on, each unit's vane
joins the same Home app grouping as your real blinds and shades, and a room-level "close
the blinds" can reach your louvres. Observed on a house with Matter blinds paired directly
to HomeKit. Enable it only if you want fixed angles and have no window coverings in
HomeKit to collide with.

## Local LAN control

**`localControl` cannot work at present, and not because of anything in this plugin.**

Authenticating to a unit's WiFi adapter needs two per-device secrets that only the vendor
cloud hands out: the adapter `password` (from the `adapter_update` socket event) and
`cryptoSerial` (from `GET /devices/{serial}/status`). Around **2026-07-31 Mitsubishi's
cloud stopped serving both**, on unrelated accounts and on a second client stack
([pykumo #78](https://github.com/dlarrick/pykumo/issues/78), reproduced by its
maintainer), so no client can compute a local token.

You do not need to do anything. The plugin retries for about an hour, logs one warning,
and runs everything over the cloud. Nothing is written to your config, so if Mitsubishi
restores the fields local control comes back on its own at the next restart. Leaving
`localControl: true` costs nothing; set it to `false` to silence the warning.

## Temperature display

HomeKit stores temperatures in Celsius and converts for display. The Home app **rounds**
that conversion while the Comfort app **truncates** it, so the same stored value can read
72°F in one and 71°F in the other.

**Setpoints: solved.** The units accept 0.1°C granularity, so every setpoint you write is
snapped to the Celsius that displays as the whole °F you asked for under *both* renderers
— the ceiling of the exact conversion, not the nearest 0.1. The two apps agree by
construction. This applies to new changes only; a setpoint you have not touched keeps
whatever value it was last set to.

**Current temperature: partly.** Indoor units report measured room temperature in 0.5°C
steps, a hardware limit, so the displayed value can still differ by ~1°F between apps. A
unit with a paired wireless sensor reports a much finer value and does not have this
problem.

Outdoor temperature is not available — the cloud API does not expose it, and the outdoor
unit's sensor is reachable only over a direct CN105 serial connection.

**Matter:** not supported. Homebridge does not yet expose the FanControl features or
handlers a Matter build would need for vane and swing, and losing those is the whole
reason this plugin exists. HAP only until that changes.
