// Regression test for the off-unit setpoint bug.
//
// HomeKit sends a setpoint independently of the unit's on/off state. When an
// automation (e.g. "turn off the AC when the skylight opens") captures a unit's
// full state, opening the skylight re-pushes each unit's last setpoint alongside
// `off`. The old code's off branch sent a bare `{ spHeat: temp }` with no
// operationMode, which the Kumo v3 API rejects with `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff`
// (HTTP 400) — producing a cluster of red errors on every skylight-open event
// even though the unit shut off fine.
//
// The unit is off, so there is nothing to set: no command should be sent. The
// requested value is cached + echoed to HomeKit so the slider doesn't snap back.
//
// ---- What the HeaterCooler migration changed about this test ----------------
//   * The setpoint no longer arrives on TargetTemperature (that characteristic
//     does not exist on HeaterCooler). It arrives on HeatingThresholdTemperature
//     or CoolingThresholdTemperature, which are the setpoint controls in every
//     mode now. Both route into the same guard, so both are exercised below —
//     under Thermostat one characteristic covered both device fields, here it
//     takes two writers to cover the same ground.
//   * The independence that makes the bug possible is, if anything, sharper: the
//     off is `Active`, a physically separate characteristic, so a controller can
//     and does write a threshold to a unit it just powered down.
//   * The echoed value is the *quantized* setpoint, not the raw request — writes
//     are snapped onto the whole-°F grid (src/temperature.ts) before anything
//     else happens. That is still "the slider holds": 21°C and 21.2°C are the
//     same 70°F, which is what the user actually asked for and what the Home app
//     displays. Arithmetic is spelled out at each assertion; its last step is a
//     CEILING to the device's 0.1°C, not a round, so that the value reads back as
//     the intended degree in the Comfort app (which truncates) as well as in the
//     Home app (which rounds). See storedC in src/temperature.ts.
