// Regression test: an "AC off" scene must not leave a unit running.
//
// A HomeKit "turn off AC" scene captures each unit's full state and, when it
// fires, re-pushes the off *and* the captured setpoints. HomeKit dispatches these
// concurrently in an arbitrary order. A setpoint dispatched after the off reaches
// the LAN adapter as a bare, mode-less write (local setpoint commands carry no
// mode/power — see local-api.ts) and powers the unit back on. Observed live
// 2026-07-11: the Living room (an AUTO unit) "restarted" in dry after the off
// automation, because its two AUTO threshold writes were dispatched after the off
// — the mutex sent {mode:off} then two bare setpoints.
//
// Fix: a HomeKit off request opens a short suppression window; setpoint writes
// during it are cached/echoed but not sent, so the off is the last thing the
// adapter sees. The setpoints dispatched *before* the off are handled by the
// separate hold (off-scene-pre-setpoint.test.ts).
//
// ---- What the HeaterCooler migration changed about this test ----------------
// Nothing about the physical failure. Only the surfaces moved:
//   * The scene's off used to be TargetHeatingCoolingState=OFF. HeaterCooler has
//     no OFF mode — power is the separate `Active` characteristic — so the off is
//     now setActive(INACTIVE). It still calls noteModeIntent('off') synchronously
//     before its own await, which is what opens the suppression window in time
//     for the siblings dispatched behind it.
//   * The captured setpoints used to be TargetTemperature plus, on an AUTO unit,
//     the two threshold handles. TargetTemperature is gone; the two thresholds
//     are now the setpoint controls in every mode, so they carry the whole scene
//     payload.
//   * HeaterCooler puts fan speed on the same tile (RotationSpeed), so a scene
//     capturing this accessory captures that too — a new fourth writer that did
//     not exist under Thermostat. It is the same hazard: a bare fanSpeed write on
//     the LAN path carries no mode, and `mode` is the only thing that expresses
//     on/off locally, so a trailing one revives the unit exactly like a trailing
//     setpoint. It shares the setpoint guard (accessory.ts:setRotationSpeed) and
//     the burst below now covers it.
