// Regression test for the dry-mode setpoint field bug.
//
// On the Kumo v3 cloud, Dry mode holds its temperature setpoint in `spCool`
// (there is no spDry field). The old code routed dry through the catch-all
// `else` branch that writes/reads `spHeat`, so dry-mode temperature changes
// silently did nothing — the cloud accepted the spHeat write but the unit
// ignored it (and some writes 400'd with `invalidSpHeatRange`). Live-confirmed
// against the real account: a unit in dry reports e.g. spCool=25, spHeat=23, and
// the plugin surfaced 23 (the wrong field). Writing spCool while in dry is
// adopted and the unit stays in dry.
//
// Under HeaterCooler there is no single TargetTemperature left to mis-route:
// spHeat and spCool each own a characteristic (HeatingThresholdTemperature /
// CoolingThresholdTemperature) and they are the setpoint controls in EVERY mode,
// not just AUTO. The field now follows the characteristic, not the mode, so the
// `else`-branch class of bug cannot recur. What still has to hold — and is what
// these tests pin — is that the setpoint the Home app actually *surfaces* while
// dehumidifying is the spCool one: dry reports TargetHeaterCoolerState COOL, and
// in COOL the Home app shows the cooling threshold. Break either half of that
// pair (map dry to HEAT, or back the cooling threshold with spHeat) and the
// original bug is back: the user drags the dry setpoint and the unit ignores it.
//
// `usesSetPointInDryMode` survives in one place only — the mirror push, which
// reconstructs a dry command by hand and must not attach a spCool to a unit that
// dehumidifies at a fixed setpoint. It still defaults to "has a setpoint" until
// the async profile arrives, so the common case works immediately.
//
// NOTE ON EXPECTED VALUES: every setpoint write is snapped to the exact Celsius
// of the nearest whole °F on the way out (src/temperature.ts,
// quantizeSetpointInRange), because HAP's minStep only constrains the outbound
// path and a controller can write any float inbound. So the value asserted below
// is the quantized one, not the one HomeKit sent. The first write test spells the
// arithmetic out; the rest call `quantizeSetpointC` for the expectation, because
// hand-copied arithmetic rots — two of the comments here had drifted a whole
// 0.1°C step behind the quantizer (they described rounding, and it takes the
// CEILING so a truncating renderer shows the same degree). The mirror path is
// deliberately exempt — it copies a value the source already quantized.
