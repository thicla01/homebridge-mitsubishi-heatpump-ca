// Regression test for the AUTO setpoint band.
//
// These units report spAuto: null and keep the auto band in spHeat (low/heat
// bound) and spCool (high/cool bound) — verified against live device data (every
// poll showed `Auto: null` with independent spHeat/spCool). HomeKit shows that as
// a temperature *range* (two handles) whenever the mode is AUTO.
//
// The original bug: AUTO collapsed to the single TargetTemperature characteristic
// which, with spAuto null, fell back to spHeat — so the cooling side of the band
// was invisible and unsettable, and any write of that one characteristic drove
// both edges to the same value.
//
// The primary service is now HeaterCooler, not Thermostat, which changes what
// this file protects in two ways:
//
//   1. TargetTemperature does not exist on HeaterCooler. The heating and cooling
//      thresholds are THE setpoint controls in every mode — heat threshold in
//      HEAT, cool threshold in COOL, both as a range in AUTO. So the collapse is
//      now structurally impossible rather than merely patched around: there is no
//      second characteristic that can write both edges from one value. The test
//      below asserts that absence directly, so a future re-introduction of a
//      single combined setpoint control fails here instead of in someone's house.
//
//   2. Every inbound setpoint is snapped to the exact Celsius of the nearest
//      whole °F before it is sent (src/temperature.ts, quantizeSetpointInRange).
//      That is why the expected command values below are not the values HomeKit
//      "sent" — see the per-test arithmetic. It is deliberate: HAP applies a
//      characteristic's minStep only on the OUTBOUND path, so a controller write
//      of "72°F" arrives as whatever Celsius float it produced, and without the
//      snap the unit stores 22.2000000000003 or 22.5 and the Mitsubishi app shows
//      73°F for a 72°F tap.
//
// The snap takes the CEILING of the 0.1°C step, not the nearest one, because the
// Mitsubishi Comfort app truncates when it renders °C as °F while the Home app
// rounds (measured live 2026-07-27, see storedC in src/temperature.ts). So
// 71.6°F → 72°F → 22.222…°C stores as 22.3, not 22.2. Every worked arithmetic
// comment below ends at the ceiling for that reason.
//
// Still asserted, unchanged in spirit:
//   - getHeatingThresholdTemperature -> spHeat,  getCoolingThresholdTemperature -> spCool
//   - setHeatingThresholdTemperature -> { spHeat }, setCoolingThresholdTemperature -> { spCool }
//     (one key per command — neither write clobbers the other edge)
//   - zone updates sync both threshold characteristics
//   - the 1.5.2 powered-off guard applies (no bare setpoint to an off unit)
