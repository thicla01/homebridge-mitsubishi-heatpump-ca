// Regression test: a scene setpoint dispatched *before* the off must not stick.
//
// The 1.7.2 fix (off-scene-setpoint-race.test.ts) stops a setpoint that lands
// AFTER an off from reviving the unit. But HomeKit dispatches a scene's captured
// setpoints and its off concurrently in arbitrary order, and a setpoint that
// lands just BEFORE the off arrives while the unit is still on — so it passes
// the guard and sends, permanently rewriting the device's stored setpoint.
//
// Observed live 2026-07-26 (19:26:56 log burst): the "AC off" scene wrote the
// Living room's stale captured spCool of 25°C, then turned it off. The Living
// room is a mirror target of the Kitchen (22.5°C), and mirroring is
// edge-triggered — nothing re-synced the two until the Kitchen next changed, so
// the two tiles showed setpoints 2.5°C apart for 36 minutes.
//
// Fix: hold each setpoint write briefly before sending it, so an off arriving
// in the same burst cancels it whichever order the two were dispatched in.
//
// ---- What the HeaterCooler migration changed about this test ----------------
// The hazard is unchanged; only the characteristics it travels on moved.
//   * The off no longer arrives on TargetHeatingCoolingState=OFF. HeaterCooler
//     splits power out into `Active`, so the scene's off is setActive(INACTIVE).
//     `noteModeIntent('off')` still runs synchronously before that command's
//     await, which is what lets a sibling handler in the same burst see it.
//   * The captured setpoints no longer arrive on TargetTemperature (gone — there
//     is no such characteristic on HeaterCooler). They arrive on the two
//     threshold characteristics, which are the setpoint controls in EVERY mode
//     now, not just AUTO. So both writers below are threshold writers.
// The hold (accessory.ts:holdSetpointWrite) is still the only thing standing
// between "scene fired" and "device permanently holds a stale setpoint".
//
// Setpoint values are quantized onto the whole-°F grid before sending
// (src/temperature.ts), so the expected command values below are the quantized
// ones, not the raw request. Each is derived in-line where it matters. The last
// step of that derivation is a CEILING to the 0.1°C the device stores, not a
// round: the Mitsubishi Comfort app truncates °C→°F where the Home app rounds,
// and only the ceiling reads back as the intended degree under both (measured
// live 2026-07-27, see storedC in src/temperature.ts).
