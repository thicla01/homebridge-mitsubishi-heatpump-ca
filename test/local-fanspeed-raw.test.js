// Fan-speed writes on the local path, and the raw passthrough the mirror needs.
//
// History: through 1.8.2 `Commands.fanSpeed` was a coarse auto/low/medium/high
// enum that a lossy `mapFanSpeedToLocal` translated into the adapter's real
// vocabulary (auto/superQuiet/quiet/low/powerful/superPowerful). The two
// overlapped in *spelling* with DIFFERENT meanings — coarse 'low' meant local
// 'quiet', coarse 'medium' meant local 'low' — which is exactly why the mirror
// path had to add `fanSpeedRaw` to bypass the mapper. The coarse enum had no
// producer anywhere in the plugin, so it is gone: `fanSpeed` now IS the adapter
// vocabulary and nothing is translated.
//
// `fanSpeedRaw` survives for one reason: a mirror push must copy whatever string
// the *source unit reported*, which may be a speed this fork has not enumerated.
// So raw is written verbatim and unvalidated, and takes precedence over
// `fanSpeed` on the local path.
//
// Why an invalid `fanSpeed` throws rather than being dropped: the adapter does
// not validate. A write of fanSpeed:"high" returns HTTP 200 and is silently
// ignored — the unit simply never changes speed, with no error anywhere.
// buildLocalCommandBody is the only validation layer there is, and it throws
// before any I/O so nothing is half-written.
