// Regression test: a scene/automation "turn off" must actually turn off a unit
// that is running in DRY (or fan-only VENT).
//
// Bug: dry and fan-only have no HomeKit *mode* of their own, so the plugin
// reported the climate tile as OFF while the unit was running (dry/vent were
// surfaced only through their separate Dry/Fan switches). A HomeKit
// off-automation writes the tile's off characteristic. When the unit was in dry,
// that characteristic already read OFF, so iOS suppressed the redundant write —
// the setter never fired, no `operationMode:'off'` reached the unit, and the
// still-ON Dry switch kept it dehumidifying. Live-confirmed the trigger is a
// scene/automation.
//
// Upstream's 1.7.1 fix (B) was to lie: report the Thermostat as COOL while in
// dry/vent so the off write stopped being redundant. That workaround is GONE and
// must not be reinstated. It only existed because Thermostat's OFF meant two
// things at once — "not heating or cooling" AND "powered down" — so honesty about
// the first cost you the second. HeaterCooler splits them:
//
//   Active                    on/off. THIS is what an off-automation writes.
//   CurrentHeaterCoolerState  what the unit is doing: INACTIVE/IDLE/HEATING/COOLING.
//   TargetHeaterCoolerState   the requested mode: AUTO/HEAT/COOL. No OFF member.
//
// The regression is therefore structurally impossible *provided* a running
// dry/vent unit reports Active=ACTIVE. If Active ever read INACTIVE while the
// unit was running, iOS would suppress the redundant Active=0 exactly as before
// and the original bug would be back through the new characteristic — so that is
// what these tests pin down. Current state can now be honest: dry runs the
// compressor and the coil cold (COOLING), vent moves air without heating or
// cooling (IDLE) — and IDLE, unlike the old OFF, still means "on".
