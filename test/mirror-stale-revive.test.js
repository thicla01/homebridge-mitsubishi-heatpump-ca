// Regression: a stale cloud/streaming reading must not revive a mirror target
// after the source was turned off locally.
//
// Real-world failure (skylight "AC off" scene, 2026-07-23 06:40): the kitchen
// (mirror source) was turned OFF over the LAN, but the Kumo cloud lags ~7-10s and
// a stale `device_update` still reporting the kitchen as `cool` arrived a few
// seconds later. A local command does not refresh the "local authoritative"
// window (only a local poll did), so when the kitchen's local poll was starved
// during the all-units command burst that stale `cool` got APPLIED — briefly
// flipping the kitchen's cached state back to `cool`. That fired the source hook,
// and the mirror sent a REAL `cool` command to the living room, reviving it while
// the kitchen itself was (and stayed) off.
//
// Fix: a successful LOCAL command marks the unit locally-authoritative, so stale
// cloud/streaming updates are dropped for the authoritative window and never reach
// the mirror.
//
// The off itself now travels through HeaterCooler's `Active` characteristic rather
// than a Thermostat mode of OFF, which makes this regression *easier* to hit, not
// harder: an off is no longer a mode transition iOS might collapse, so scenes send
// it every time. The command on the wire is unchanged (`operationMode: 'off'`), and
// so is the window it has to arm.
