# Changelog

All notable changes to homebridge-mitsubishi-heatpump.

Entries at 1.8.2 and below are inherited from
[homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort](https://github.com/burtherman/homebridge-mitsubishi-comfort),
the upstream project this was forked from.

- **1.8.2** - Keep retrying for local credentials; stop a scene setpoint from rewriting a mirror target (July 2026)
  - Fixed: **units silently stranded on the cloud for the life of the process.** The local password arrives only via the `adapter_update` socket event, and `initLocalControl` waited a fixed 25s for it before giving up for good. Measured on real hardware 2026-07-26: of five units, two answered the nudge in 6s, one took **65s** (well past the window), and two never answered at all — so a healthy unit could miss the window by timing alone and never get local control, losing the fast LAN path and its per-unit cloud fallback
  - Fix: the 25s startup gather is unchanged, but any device still missing credentials is now **re-nudged every 60s in the background** and admitted to local control the moment its credentials arrive (starting local polling if it isn't already running). A nudge is a single socket emit, so retrying costs nothing; the expensive LAN sweep runs only when a device actually hands over its credentials. The retry stops once every device is local, and is torn down on shutdown. This also means a unit whose adapter is wedged rejoins local control **automatically** when it recovers, instead of needing a Homebridge restart
  - Fixed: **a scene setpoint dispatched just *before* an off permanently rewrote the device's stored setpoint.** The 1.7.2 guard only suppresses setpoints that land *after* the off; HomeKit dispatches a scene's captured setpoints and its off concurrently in arbitrary order, so one landing first arrives while the unit is still on, passes the guard, and sends. Observed live 2026-07-26 (19:26:56 burst): the "AC off" scene wrote the living room's stale captured `spCool` of 25°C, then turned it off. The living room is a mirror target of the kitchen (22.5°C), and mirroring is edge-triggered — nothing re-synced them until the kitchen next changed, so the two tiles sat 2.5°C apart for 36 minutes
  - Fix: each setpoint write is **held ~1.5s before being sent**, so an off arriving in the same burst cancels it whichever order the two were dispatched in. Writes are keyed per setpoint (the two AUTO handles stay independent) with a generation counter, so a drag now sends only its final value instead of every intermediate one. The mirror contract is unchanged — the target is still free between source changes; what's fixed is a scene write the user never intended
  - `node:test`: `test/local-cred-retry.test.js` (7 cases: late-arriving credentials are admitted, only stragglers re-nudged, retry stops when complete, overlapping passes suppressed, cleanup clears the timer) and `test/off-scene-pre-setpoint.test.js` (5 cases, RED→GREEN on the pre-off ordering for both the threshold handles and plain `TargetTemperature`, plus drag-supersede; two controls pass either way). **104 tests total green**
  - Code: `platform.ts:initLocalControl/gatherLocalCreds/admitLocalDevices/scheduleLocalCredRetry/retryLocalCreds`, `accessory.ts:holdSetpointWrite/setTargetTemperature/setThresholdTemperature`
- **1.8.1** - Don't let a stale cloud reading revive a mirror target after an off (July 2026)
  - Fixed: an "AC off" skylight scene turned all units off, but the **living room (mirror target) came back on** while the **kitchen (source) stayed off**. Root cause was a stale cloud reading driving the mirror, not the mirror logic itself: the scene turned the kitchen off over the LAN, but the Kumo cloud lags ~7-10s and a streaming `device_update` still reporting the kitchen as `cool` arrived a few seconds later. The plugin normally ignores cloud/streaming while a local read is recent (the 45s `LOCAL_AUTHORITATIVE_MS` guard), but **only a local *poll* refreshed that window — a local *command* did not**. During the all-units command burst the kitchen's local poll was starved, the window lapsed, the stale `cool` was applied, briefly flipping the kitchen's cached state back on, which fired the source `onStatusUpdate` hook → the mirror sent a **real `cool` command to the living room**. The kitchen self-corrected on its next local poll, but the living room was already physically on and stayed on (edge-triggered — nothing re-pushed off)
  - Fix: a **successful local command now refreshes `lastLocalUpdateTs`** (marks the unit local-authoritative), exactly as a local poll does. After an `off` the cloud's lagging `cool` is dropped for the 45s window — during which local polls confirm the real `off` — so the kitchen's cached state never flips back on and the mirror never fires a phantom revive. Also fixes the kitchen's *own* tile flickering back to "Cooling" for a few seconds after an off. The mirror is untouched — it still follows the kitchen faithfully; a genuine local change (wall thermostat / Kumo app, observed via local poll) still mirrors normally
  - One-line change in `accessory.ts:sendDeviceCommand` (bump `lastLocalUpdateTs` on local-command success)
  - `node:test` regression (`test/mirror-stale-revive.test.js`, 2 cases): a stale cloud `cool` after a local `off` must NOT re-fire the source hook (reproduced the exact `[off, cool]` signature RED→GREEN); a *real* local change after an `off` still fires it (following preserved). 92 tests total green
  - **Live-verified on the Pi (2026-07-23):** hand-patched + restarted; drove kitchen→cool (mirror carried cool@24 to living in ~11s), kitchen→off (mirror carried off in ~15s), living room held off for ~3 min with no phantom `cool` push
  - Code: `accessory.ts:sendDeviceCommand`
- **1.8.0** - Device mirroring: one unit follows another (July 2026)
  - **Opt-in** via a `mirror` array of `{ source, target }` device-serial pairs (default absent → inert). Makes `target` follow `source`: whenever the source's commanded state changes, the source's full state (mode + setpoints + on/off + fan) is copied to the target. Built for a unit with no wall control (living room) to shadow one that has it (kitchen)
  - **Edge-triggered + one-way:** the target follows the source only at the moment the source changes; between changes the target is free (a manual target change holds until the next source change). Any source change re-applies the source's *full* state, so a source temp change also re-syncs mode/power (revives a manually-off target — by design)
  - **Source-agnostic:** triggers on the source's *observed* state, so wall thermostat (MHK2) / IR remote, Kumo app, and HomeKit all fire it. Fired from `processZoneUpdate` (observed changes) + every setter (instant HomeKit changes). Change detection is a **mode-aware signature** (mode-relevant setpoints + fan, rounded 0.1) so inactive-setpoint drift can't spuriously re-clobber the target; first observation after startup seeds the baseline without pushing
  - **Faithful + safe push:** `applyMirror` normalizes `autoHeat`/`autoCool` → `auto`, clamps setpoints to the target's own range, skips modes the target can't do, and sends **one combined atomic command** (so the 1.7.2 trailing-setpoint race can't recur) via the local-first path. Fan speed mirrored verbatim via new `Commands.fanSpeedRaw` (bypasses the coarse enum locally; folded into `fanSpeed` on cloud)
  - New `src/mirror.ts` (`MirrorController` + `signature`/`toMirrorState`); `accessory.ts` (`onStatusUpdate`/`notifyStatusListeners` source hook, `applyMirror`/`clampSetpoint`/`normalizeMirrorMode` target side); `platform.ts` (construct/teardown); `local-api.ts` + `kumo-api.ts` (`toCloudCommands`) fan passthrough; `settings.ts`; `config.schema.json`
  - `node:test`: `test/mirror-controller.test.js`, `test/mirror-apply.test.js`, `test/mirror-hook.test.js`, `test/local-fanspeed-raw.test.js`. 90 tests total green
  - Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-device-mirroring-design.md`. See "Device Mirroring"
- **1.7.2** - Don't let an "AC off" scene revive the unit it's turning off (July 2026)
  - Fixed: an "AC off" HomeKit **scene** could leave a unit **running (in dry)** right after it fired. A scene is a saved snapshot of each thermostat's full state, so on every trigger it re-pushes `TargetHeatingCoolingState = OFF` *and* the captured setpoints — `TargetTemperature`, and for an AUTO unit the two AUTO band handles (`HeatingThresholdTemperature`/`CoolingThresholdTemperature`). HomeKit dispatches these concurrently in an arbitrary order. A setpoint dispatched **after** the off reached the LAN adapter as a bare, mode-less write (local commands carry no `power` field — `mode` alone carries on/off, see `local-api.ts`), which powered the unit back **on** in its prior mode
  - Root cause: the 1.5.2 powered-off guard suppresses a setpoint only when the *cached* mode already reads off. During the concurrent scene burst the off command's optimistic state update hasn't landed yet, so setpoint handlers still see "on" and send a live command. With local control, that trailing bare setpoint revives the unit
  - **1.7.1 connection:** before 1.7.1 a dry unit read `TargetHeatingCoolingState = OFF`, so iOS suppressed the off write entirely — there was no off for the setpoints to race (the unit just never turned off, the original 1.7.1 bug). 1.7.1 made the off fire, which *exposed* this race
  - Fix: a HomeKit off request opens a short suppression window (`offRequestedAt`, set synchronously via `noteModeIntent()` **before** the off command's await, so sibling handlers in the same burst observe it). While the window is open — or the unit already reads off — `shouldSuppressSetpoint()` returns true and `setTargetTemperature` / `setThresholdTemperature` cache + echo the value to HomeKit **without sending**, so the off is the last thing the adapter sees. Any active-mode command (heat/cool/auto, dry-on, vent-on) clears the window. Setpoints dispatched *before* the off are harmless — the off follows and wins. Given the LAN per-device mutex serializes in dispatch order, the unit reliably ends off
  - **Live-verified end-to-end on the Pi (2026-07-11):** Living room (the AUTO unit, whose scene pushes `TargetTemperature` + both AUTO handles). Two runs — the off was accepted and **all three setpoint writes were suppressed** (only `OFF` reached the device); the unit turned off and stayed off (confirmed via the cloud once its local-control sync lag caught up). Also empirically proved a HomeKit-side workaround is *not* enough: re-recording the scene while the unit was off did **not** stop HomeKit from replaying the setpoints — the plugin fix is what holds the line
  - `node:test` regression (`test/off-scene-setpoint-race.test.js`, 3 cases): replays Living's exact concurrent dispatch order and asserts no setpoint follows the off; a threshold write in the same burst as an off is suppressed; a threshold write with no recent off still sends (control). Watched RED→GREEN. 60 tests total green
  - Code: `accessory.ts:noteModeIntent / shouldSuppressSetpoint / setTargetHeatingCoolingState / setTargetTemperature / setThresholdTemperature / setDryOn / setFanOnlyOn`
- **1.7.1** - Dry/vent units now respond to a thermostat "off" (July 2026)
  - Fixed: a unit running in **dry** (or fan-only **vent**) would not turn off when a HomeKit scene/automation set the thermostat to Off. Root cause: dry/vent have no HomeKit Thermostat state, so the plugin reported the Thermostat as **OFF** while the unit ran (dry/vent were surfaced only through their separate Dry/Fan switches). An off-automation writes `TargetHeatingCoolingState = OFF`; since the thermostat already read OFF in dry, iOS suppressed the redundant write, the setter never fired, no `operationMode:'off'` reached the unit, and the still-ON Dry/Fan switch kept it running
  - Fix: dry/vent now map to **COOL** on both `mapToTargetHeatingCoolingState` (so the off-write is a real COOL→OFF transition iOS sends) and `mapToCurrentHeatingCoolingState` (so a running dry/vent unit shows as on — "Cooling" — instead of a misleading "Off"; matters because the Dry/Fan switches are often invisible on already-paired accessories per the 1.5.1 cache caveat). COOL fits dry naturally — its setpoint already lives in `spCool`. The optimistic updates in `setDryOn`/`setFanOnlyOn` now derive from these maps so there's no window where the Target is still OFF right after engaging the switch. Dry/vent are still *set* via their dedicated switches; the thermostat OFF path (`operationMode:'off'`) is unchanged and mode-agnostic
  - **Trade-off:** the tile reads "Cooling" while dehumidifying (HomeKit has no dry/fan state), and any "if AC is cooling" automations will trip on dry/vent. Chosen deliberately over a running unit looking "Off"
  - Live-verified end-to-end on the Pi (2026-07-10): Rear bedroom set to dry via the Kumo app, the off automation fired, `[MODE CHANGE] Rear bedroom: HomeKit sent OFF mode` appeared (it was suppressed before the fix) and the unit powered down — confirmed off in the Kumo app
  - `node:test` regression (`test/dry-off-thermostat.test.js`, 9 cases): dry/vent Target non-OFF (COOL), dry/vent Current COOL, genuinely-off still OFF, heat/cool unchanged, off-command still routes to `operationMode:'off'`, optimistic-window Target non-OFF. Watched RED→GREEN. 57 tests total green
  - Code: `accessory.ts:mapToTargetHeatingCoolingState / mapToCurrentHeatingCoolingState / setDryOn / setFanOnlyOn`
- **1.7.0** - Local LAN control + 0.1°C setpoint step (June 2026)
  - **Opt-in local control** (`localControl: true`, default off): control/read each unit directly over the LAN, falling back to cloud per-unit; cloud streaming stays as the fallback. Modeled on HA's `mitsubishi_comfort` integration. See the "Local LAN Control" section
  - New `src/local-api.ts`: the pykumo token algorithm (live-verified against real hardware — a signed status read returned 200, and a command was accepted), `LocalKumoClient` (per-device mutex + forgiving timeout), command/status mapping (`mode`/`vaneDir`, no `power`, 0.1 rounding), and LAN discovery (sweep + token-match, since the cloud gives no IP/MAC)
  - Credentials reuse what we already see: local `password` from the `adapter_update` socket event (was stripped + discarded), `cryptoSerial` from `/devices/{serial}/status` (was fetched + unused)
  - Local-authoritative status: while a local poll is fresh (≤45s), cloud updates are dropped so the cloud's ~7–10s lag can't clobber it
  - **0.1°C setpoint step** (`minStep` 0.5→0.1 on TargetTemperature + the AUTO threshold handles): HomeKit is Celsius-native, so 0.5 forced "72°F" to snap to 22.5°C and read back as 73°F in the Kumo app. 0.1 lets 72°F store as ~22.2°C and round-trip faithfully. Live-verified the units honor 0.1°C (the cloud stored a 23.3 setpoint exactly). Applies to the cloud path too
  - Live-verified end-to-end on the Pi: 5/5 units discovered + controlled locally, polling at 15s, zero errors; the deployed module's read + command both round-tripped against hardware
  - `node:test`: `test/local-api.test.js` (13 cases) + `test/local-integration.test.js` (6 cases) — token, command builder, status mapping, subnet enumeration, local-first routing, cloud fallback, local-authoritative drop. 48 tests total green
  - Code: `src/local-api.ts`, `platform.ts`, `accessory.ts`, `kumo-api.ts`, `settings.ts`, `config.schema.json`
- **1.6.0** - AUTO-mode dual setpoints (June 2026)
  - In AUTO the Home app now shows a temperature range (two handles) instead of a single collapsed setpoint. Exposes the optional `HeatingThresholdTemperature` (↔ `spHeat`, low/heat edge) and `CoolingThresholdTemperature` (↔ `spCool`, high/cool edge) on the Thermostat service
  - Before: in AUTO the plugin returned only the single `TargetTemperature`, which fell back to `spHeat` because these units report `spAuto: null` — so the cooling edge of the band was invisible and unsettable
  - Live-confirmed (real account + Pi): all 5 units report `autoModeDisable: false` (auto IS supported) and `spAuto: null` (so AUTO uses the `spHeat`/`spCool` band, not a single center). End-to-end on Front bedroom via config-ui-x: AUTO engaged, cooling handle → `{spCool}` and heating handle → `{spHeat}` independently (no clobber), cloud held the band across a streaming reconcile
  - Writes are independent and inherit the 1.5.2 powered-off guard (cache + echo, no `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff` 400) + revert-on-failure. Zone/streaming updates sync both handles. `TargetTemperature` and the HEAT/COOL/DRY paths are untouched (additive change)
  - Characteristics added in the constructor so they publish via the normal discovery path; props set from the device profile range in `applyDeviceProfile`
  - `node:test` regression (`test/auto-setpoint.test.js`, 9 cases): read sync, independent spHeat/spCool writes, the two-handle drag staying two-sided, off-guard, and heat/cool controls proving no regression. 29 tests total green
  - Code: `accessory.ts:getHeatingThresholdTemperature / getCoolingThresholdTemperature / setThresholdTemperature / applyDeviceProfile / processZoneUpdate`
- **1.5.3** - Route the Dry-mode setpoint to `spCool` (June 2026)
  - Fixed: in Dry mode the plugin read and wrote the temperature setpoint to `spHeat`, but the Kumo v3 cloud keeps the dry setpoint in `spCool` (there is no `spDry` field). So dry-mode temperature changes silently did nothing — the cloud accepted the `spHeat` write but the unit ignored it, and out-of-range values 400'd with `invalidSpHeatRange`. Reads surfaced the wrong field (e.g. a unit in dry reporting `spCool=25, spHeat=23` showed 23°C)
  - Live-confirmed (real account, `app-prod.kumocloud.com/v3`): four dry captures held the setpoint in `spCool`; `GET /devices/{serial}/profile` returns `usesSetPointInDryMode: true`; a `POST /devices/send-command {commands:{spCool:24}}` round-trip was adopted and the unit stayed in dry (no flip to cool, no `operationMode` needed)
  - Fix: explicit `dry` branch in both `setTargetTemperature` (write → `{ spCool }`) and `getTargetTempFromStatus` (read → `spCool`), gated on a new `dryUsesSetpoint()` helper. Surfaced `usesSetPointInDryMode` from the `profile_update` payload (was dropped) into `DeviceProfile`. The gate defaults to "has a setpoint" until the async profile loads, so the common case works immediately; units reporting `usesSetPointInDryMode: false` stay setpoint-less (write falls through to the heat branch, read uses the existing fallback)
  - HomeKit: corrective + additive. A dry unit reads as `TargetHeatingCoolingState === 0` (OFF) on the Thermostat, so the stock Home app surfaces no dry-setpoint UI; this fixes the value/route for clients that read the raw `TargetTemperature` characteristic. Heat/cool/auto untouched. The 1.5.2 off-guard is unaffected (a dry unit has `power===1, operationMode==='dry'`)
  - `node:test` regression (`test/dry-setpoint.test.js`): dry write→`{spCool}`, dry write before profile loads→`{spCool}`, gated-false dry→`{spHeat}`, cool/heat controls, dry read→`spCool`, gated-false read→fallback. Proven to fail the 3 core cases against the pre-fix build
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setTargetTemperature / getTargetTempFromStatus / dryUsesSetpoint`, `settings.ts:DeviceProfile`, `kumo-api.ts:profile_update handler`
- **1.5.2** - Don't send a setpoint to a powered-off unit (June 2026)
  - Fixed: setting a TargetTemperature while a unit is off sent a bare `{ spHeat }` with no `operationMode`, which the Kumo v3 API rejects with `modeRequiredWhenDeviceOff` (HTTP 400). Every such attempt logged a cluster of red errors (`Request failed with status: 400` → `Send command failed` → `Failed to set target temperature`)
  - Real-world trigger: a HomeKit automation/scene that turns the AC off (e.g. "off when the skylight opens") captures each thermostat's *full* state, so firing it re-pushes the last setpoint alongside `off`. The `off` succeeded; the trailing setpoint on the now-off unit produced the 400s. The "all units, same second, `HomeKit sent`" log signature distinguishes a controller-pushed burst from a user tap
  - Fix: `setTargetTemperature` now short-circuits when `power === 0 || operationMode === 'off'` — it caches the value and echoes it to HomeKit (so the slider holds) without sending a doomed command. Heat/cool/auto paths unchanged
  - `node:test` regression (`test/setpoint-while-off.test.js`): off → no command sent (failed pre-fix with `1 !== 0`), off → value still echoed, heat → setpoint still sent (control)
  - CI: bumped `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` to `@v5` in `publish.yml` ahead of the 2026-06-16 Node-20 runner deprecation (no functional change to publishing)
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setTargetTemperature`
- **1.5.1** - Publish runtime-added features to HomeKit (June 2026)
  - Fixed: the fan-only switch (since 1.4.0), the dry switch (1.5.0), the humidity characteristic, and the filter indicator were all added to the accessory *after* it was published to the bridge (from async `profile_update` / first-reading callbacks) but never re-published — so they existed in memory and the HAP cache but never reached the Home app
  - Root cause: no `api.updatePlatformAccessories([accessory])` call after a runtime structural change. Centralized in `accessory.ts:publishStructureChange()`, called at every add/remove site (switches, humidity, filter)
  - `node:test` coverage extended (`test/switch-publish.test.js`) — asserts a re-publish happens on switch add/remove and on the first humidity reading; proven to fail against the pre-fix build
  - **Operational caveat:** publishing the service is necessary but not always sufficient. HomeKit controllers cache an accessory's *service list* and only re-read it when the bridge's configuration number (`c#`) increases. iOS will not surface services added to an already-paired accessory until its cache is cleared — a full **device reboot** (clears the `homed` cache) or removing/re-adding the child bridge. Force-quitting the Home app or restarting a Home hub is not enough.
  - Child bridge accessories persist to `accessories/cachedAccessories.<username-without-colons>` (e.g. `cachedAccessories.0EA3CB05C3A2`), NOT the main `cachedAccessories`
  - Code: `accessory.ts:publishStructureChange and its 6 call sites`
- **1.5.0** - Dry (dehumidify) mode as a Switch (June 2026)
  - Exposes dry mode as a separate `Switch` service per thermostat (subtype `dry`), mirroring the fan-only switch (#14)
  - Capability-gated on `profile.hasModeDry`; a cached switch is removed if the device reports no dry support
  - Switch ON → `sendCommand({ operationMode: 'dry', power: 1 })`; OFF → `{ operationMode: 'off', power: 0 }`
  - Fan-only and dry are mutually exclusive: engaging one optimistically flips the other off, with streaming/polling as the backstop
  - HomeKit's Thermostat service has no dehumidify state, so (like fan-only) the thermostat shows OFF while dry is active; the unit's dry setpoint (`usesSetPointInDryMode`) can't be exposed through an on/off switch
  - Code: `accessory.ts:setupDrySwitch / removeDrySwitch / setDryOn / isDryActive`
- **1.4.1** - Self-healing device discovery (May 2026)
  - Fixed: a transient login/network failure at startup (e.g. a DNS blip) left the plugin idle until a manual restart — `discoverDevices()` logged the error and returned with no retry, so streaming never started
  - `discoverDevices()` now retries with exponential backoff (30s → 5min cap) and keeps retrying indefinitely, recovering on its own once connectivity returns
  - Retry is idempotent: an `accessoryHandlers` guard prevents double-registering devices across attempts
  - A transient empty zones response no longer unregisters every cached accessory as "stale" — it retries instead
  - Added `node:test` regression tests (`test/discovery-retry.test.js`, run via `npm test`)
  - Code: `platform.ts:34-38, 107-112, 136-176`
- **1.4.0** - Humidity stabilization, fan-only mode, v3 API docs (May 2026)

  - Added debug logging to the token refresh flow (#12)
- **1.3.6** - Streaming events, device profiles, filter maintenance, model number (March 2026)
  - Listen for `profile_update`, `device_status_v2`, `adapter_update`, `acoil_update` streaming events
  - Account-level Socket.IO subscription + `force_adapter_request` emits to trigger profile/status data
  - JWT user ID extraction for account-level subscribe (required for adapter_update events)
  - `DeviceProfile` interface stores per-device capabilities (modes, fan speeds, vane, setpoint limits)
  - HomeKit TargetTemperature now enforces correct min/max from device profile (e.g., 17-30°C)
  - Devices report "Not Responding" in HomeKit when `device_status_v2` reports disconnected
  - Adapter firmware version and WiFi RSSI logged (password stripped from logs)
  - HomeKit FilterMaintenance service shows filter dirty status from `displayConfig.filter`

## Historical implementation notes

Design narrative for the streaming and adaptive-polling work, moved out of `CLAUDE.md`.

### v1.3.0 - Intelligent Streaming Health Monitoring and Adaptive Polling

**🎯 Goal:** Reduce API calls by 95% while maintaining reliability through smart fallback.

#### Key Achievement
- **Before:** ~257 API calls/hour (polling every 30s + streaming)
- **After:** ~12 API calls/hour (token refresh only when streaming healthy)
- **Reduction:** 95% fewer API calls and DNS queries

#### What Changed

**1. Streaming Health Monitoring (`kumo-api.ts`)**
- Added health tracking system that monitors Socket.IO connection status
- Health check every 30s (configurable)
- Callback system notifies platform of health changes
- Relies on Socket.IO's built-in heartbeat mechanism
- Code: `kumo-api.ts:36-42, 566-647`

**2. Adaptive Polling (`platform.ts`)**
- **Normal Mode:** Streaming healthy → polling disabled (if `disablePolling: true`)
- **Degraded Mode:** Streaming fails → fast polling activates (10s intervals)
- Automatic mode switching based on streaming health
- Comprehensive logging for all state transitions
- Code: `platform.ts:25-27, 343-458`

**3. Race Condition Prevention (`accessory.ts`)**
- Timestamp-based update filtering
- Prevents old polling data from overwriting newer streaming data
- Tracks update source (streaming vs polling)
- Code: `accessory.ts:15-16, 122-145`

**4. New Configuration Options**
- `disablePolling` - Now recommended! Enables optimal streaming-only mode
- `degradedPollInterval` - Fast polling when streaming unhealthy (default: 10s)
- `streamingHealthCheckInterval` - Health check frequency (default: 30s)
- `streamingStaleThreshold` - No longer used (deprecated, kept for compatibility)

#### How It Works

**Startup:**
```
1. Streaming connects → marked healthy
2. If disablePolling=true → no polling starts
3. Only token refresh queries (every 15 min)
```

**When Streaming Disconnects:**
```
1. Health check detects disconnect
2. Platform switches to DEGRADED MODE
3. Fast polling activates (10s intervals)
4. Devices remain responsive via polling
```

**When Streaming Reconnects:**
```
1. Socket reconnects → marked healthy
2. Platform switches to NORMAL MODE
3. Polling halts (if disablePolling=true)
4. Back to streaming-only updates
```

**Logging Examples:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Mitsubishi Comfort Plugin Configuration
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Streaming: ENABLED
Polling mode: On-demand only
Strategy: Streaming primary, polling fallback only
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Streaming connection established
Monitoring 3 device(s) for real-time updates

[When streaming fails]
✗ Streaming disconnected: transport close
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠ STREAMING INTERRUPTED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
→ Switching to DEGRADED MODE
→ Polling activated: 10s intervals
```

### v1.2.0 - Real-time Streaming Support

We added Socket.IO streaming to receive real-time device updates instead of relying solely on polling.

#### Implementation Details

**Streaming Connection:**
- Server: `socket-prod.kumocloud.com`
- Protocol: Socket.IO v4
- Transport: Polling initially, upgrades to WebSocket
- Authentication: Bearer token in extraHeaders

**Flow:**
1. Platform starts streaming after device discovery
2. Socket connects and emits 'subscribe' event for each device serial
3. Server sends 'device_update' events with full device state
4. Callbacks in accessory.ts process updates immediately
5. HomeKit characteristics update in real-time

**Key Code Locations:**
- Streaming initialization: `platform.ts:219-227`
- Socket.IO setup: `kumo-api.ts:418-497`
- Device subscription: `kumo-api.ts:499-507`
- Update handling: `accessory.ts:67-103`
