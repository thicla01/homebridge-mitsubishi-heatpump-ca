 * and `cryptoSerial` vanished from `GET /devices/{serial}/status` (confirmed cloud-side
 * and account-independent — pykumo issue #78, 2026-07-31, reproduced by its maintainer).
 * Local control is dead until that reverses, and with it went the `{"c":{"sensors":...}}`
 * leaf that `local-api.ts:getSensorReadings` used for the sensor's fine-grained
 * temperature, humidity and battery.
 *
 * A `sensor_update` Socket.IO event appeared in the same window carrying exactly that
 * data per device, so it is now the only source for it. It matters for more than
 * humidity: the unit quantizes `roomTemp` to 0.5°C before reporting while the sensor
 * reports ~6 decimals (22.30543 against 22.5), and three of the four units tested
 * regulate FROM the sensor (`tempSource: 'sensor0'`), so the sensor is the real
 * thermostat. The finer value also removes a display ambiguity: 22.5°C is exactly
